## 1. Objective
Deliver a production-ready MVP that can be tested and deployed, with all critical gaps closed. This plan is based on a full codebase review and the original Delty roadmap and technical guide.

---

## 2. Critical Gaps & Action Items

### 2.1 Agent Workload Manager (Highest Priority)
- [ ] Implement full workload lifecycle:
  - [ ] Listen for workload deployment requests from backend
  - [ ] Launch Docker containers (Postgres, MinIO, custom)
  - [ ] Map ports, tunnel, and return public URLs
  - [ ] Track running containers, report status, stream logs
  - [ ] Handle errors, port conflicts, and resource limits

### 2.2 Backend Agent API
- [ ] Implement all agent endpoints:
  - [ ] Register (persist agent, return token)
  - [ ] Heartbeat (update agent status/lastSeen)
  - [ ] Report workload status (update workload state)
  - [ ] Get agent info (return agent and workload status)
- [ ] Persist agent and workload state in the database

### 2.3 Frontend UI
- [ ] Build out dashboard and workload management:
  - [ ] List workloads, show status/logs
  - [ ] Node management (list, add, view details)
  - [ ] Provision/deploy new workloads
  - [ ] Error/loading states, credential display

### 2.4 E2E & Integration Tests
- [ ] Add Playwright E2E tests for onboarding, agent lifecycle, workload deployment, and monitoring
- [ ] Add integration tests for backend-agent-docker flows

### 2.5 Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add real-time dashboards for agent/workload health
- [ ] Implement alerting for failures
- [ ] Aggregate and centralize logs

### 2.6 Production Hardening
- [ ] Add clustering/HA for Postgres/Redis
- [ ] Implement disaster recovery automation
- [ ] Add admin approval for agent registration
- [ ] Enforce TLS/mTLS for agent-backend

### 2.7 Automation & Support
- [ ] Automate log/error collection
- [ ] Provide reset/cleanup scripts
- [ ] Integrate support/help channel

## 3. Post-Fix Test & Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Manual E2E Test:**
  - [ ] Onboard a node (your machine as first node)
  - [ ] Register agent, launch agent
  - [ ] Deploy a test workload (e.g., Postgres)
  - [ ] Verify logs, status, and public access
  - [ ] Simulate agent disconnect/reconnect, Docker restart, and workload failure
- [ ] **Automated E2E/Integration Tests:**
  - [ ] All tests pass in CI
- [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting:**
  - [ ] Dashboards show real-time state
  - [ ] Alerts fire on failure
- [ ] **Security:**
  - [ ] All secrets/credentials handled securely
  - [ ] All network communication encrypted
- [ ] **Documentation:**
  - [ ] Update onboarding, deployment, and troubleshooting docs
- [ ] **Deployment Prep:**
  - [ ] Ready to deploy backend and onboarding app to server

---

## 4. Launch Readiness
- [ ] All critical flows work end-to-end
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation and support in place
- [ ] MVP is ready for real-world use and further scaling

**This plan must be executed, tested, and validated before launch. Every box must be checked.**
