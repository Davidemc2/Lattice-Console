# 10x Automation MVP Build Plan

## MVP Scope
- Self-healing infrastructure (node health checks, auto-restart)
- Auto-scaling (workload scaling based on demand)
- CI/CD pipeline (automated build, test, deploy)
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Sprint 1
- As a platform, I can monitor node health and auto-restart failed nodes
- As a developer, I have a CI pipeline that runs tests on every commit
- As a user, I can view real-time system health metrics on the dashboard

## Sprint 2
- As a platform, I can auto-scale workloads up/down based on resource usage
- As a developer, I have a CD pipeline that deploys to staging/production
- As a user, I receive alerts for critical system events (failures, scaling)

## Sprint 3
- As a platform, I can run automated compliance/security checks in CI/CD
- As a user, I can view historical metrics and alerts
- As a developer, I can roll back failed deployments automatically

## Dependencies
- Node health checks require node registration and monitoring
- CI/CD requires codebase and test suite
- Auto-scaling depends on workload metrics and orchestration

## Acceptance Criteria (Examples)
- Failed nodes are detected and restarted within 60s
- CI pipeline blocks merge on failed tests
- Auto-scaling triggers within 2 minutes of threshold breach
- Alerts are delivered to dashboard and/or email
