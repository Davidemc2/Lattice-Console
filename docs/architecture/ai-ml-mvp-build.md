# AI/ML MVP Build Plan

## MVP Scope
- Resource optimization (predictive scheduling, auto-scaling)
- Anomaly detection (system health, security)
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement

## Sprint 1
- As a platform, I can collect metrics from nodes and workloads for training models
- As a platform, I can run a basic anomaly detection model on system health metrics

## Sprint 2
- As a platform, I can use a simple ML model to recommend optimal node selection for new workloads
- As a platform, I can alert users when anomalies are detected

## Sprint 3
- As a platform, I can retrain models based on new data (feedback loop)
- As a user, I can provide feedback on workload performance and anomaly alerts

## Dependencies
- Metrics collection must be implemented before model training
- Anomaly detection requires historical data
- Feedback loop depends on user input and retraining pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria (Examples)
- Metrics are collected and stored for all nodes/workloads
- Anomaly detection model flags >90% of simulated failures
- Node selection model improves workload performance by >10%
- User feedback is stored and used in retraining
