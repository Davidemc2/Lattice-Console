# AI/ML Integration Plan

## AI/ML Use Cases
- **Resource optimization:** Predictive scheduling, auto-scaling, and workload placement
- **Anomaly detection:** Real-time monitoring for security, performance, and reliability issues
- **Fraud detection:** Identify suspicious activity in payments, node behavior, and governance
- **User support:** AI-powered chatbots and documentation search
- **Developer tools:** Code generation, API usage recommendations

## Data Strategy
- **Data collection:** Metrics from nodes, workloads, user actions, payments, and governance
- **Privacy/ethics:** Anonymize data, user opt-in, comply with GDPR/CCPA
- **Data storage:** Centralized data lake for training, distributed edge inference
- **Model lifecycle:** Versioned, auditable, and updatable models

## Continuous Learning
- **Feedback loops:** User feedback, incident reports, and system outcomes
- **A/B testing:** Experiment with new models and features
- **Model retraining:** Regularly retrain on new data, monitor drift
- **Community contributions:** Open-source model contributions, bug bounties for AI/ML
