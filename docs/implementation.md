# ðŸš€ Lattice Console: One-Shot One-Kill Implementation & Test Plan (Production-Hardened)

## Mission Objective
Build and validate a seamless, resilient, and scalable decentralized cloud platform where any laptop or spare computer can join as a Docker agent node. The onboarding process must be frictionless, robust, and testable at scale (100+ nodes). Data and workloads must be safe, observable, and recoverable. This is a mission-critical, one-shot one-kill launch. **This version is production-hardened for open source MVP release.**

## 0. MVP Onboarding App (Downloadable, Cross-Platform)
- [ ] **Develop a downloadable onboarding app for Windows, macOS, and Linux:**
  - Available from the website (e.g., Vercel-hosted web app with download links)
  - Electron or Tauri for cross-platform desktop delivery
- [ ] **App Features:**
  - User login and authentication
  - Dashboard showing node/computer status
  - "Run" button to:
    - Check/install Docker (with user permission)
    - Configure and launch the agent
    - Caffeinate the system (prevent sleep)
    - Let user set computation hours (schedule when node is active)
    - Show onboarding progress and troubleshooting tips
  - Cluster setup: Detect and configure multi-GPU (e.g., NVIDIA 8100s) or multi-node clusters
  - Unified experience for Linux, Windows, and macOS
- [ ] **User Experience:**
  - Minimal steps, clear prompts, and visual feedback
  - Option to run in background or as a scheduled task
  - Support for both single-node and cluster onboarding
  - Downloadable as a single file/installer per OS

---

## 1. End-to-End Onboarding & Agent Test
- [ ] **Run onboarding app on a real laptop (your machine first).**
- [ ] **Validate:**
  - Docker installation (auto-install if missing)
  - Agent registration and backend connectivity
  - Agent can deploy, start, stop, and report on a test workload (e.g., Postgres container)
  - All steps, errors, and edge cases are logged
- [ ] **Refine onboarding for zero-friction:**
  - Auto-detect OS, install Docker, configure agent, prevent sleep, launch agent
  - Minimal user prompts, clear error handling
  - Document with screenshots and troubleshooting
  - **Onboarding app handles all steps above automatically**

---

## 2. Agent/Node Management (Production-Hardened)
- [ ] **Robust agent health monitoring:**
  - Beyond heartbeats: monitor CPU, memory, disk, network, Docker status
  - Health check endpoints and periodic reporting
- [ ] **Graceful agent disconnection handling:**
  - Detect and handle agent disconnects, reconnects, and shutdowns
  - Offline queuing and state sync on reconnect
- [ ] **Agent capability discovery:**
  - On registration, collect and report:
    - CPU, memory, disk, network bandwidth, supported runtimes
    - Example:
      ```typescript
      interface AgentCapabilities {
        cpu: number;
        memory: number;
        disk: number;
        networkBandwidth: number;
        supportedRuntimes: string[];
      }
      ```
- [ ] **Agent versioning:**
  - Track agent versions for rolling updates and compatibility
  - Enforce minimum version requirements
- [ ] **Secure agent authentication:**
  - Use strong authentication (JWT, mTLS, or signed tokens)
  - TLS certificate management for all agent-backend communication
- [ ] **Agent registration approval workflow:**
  - Manual or automated approval for new agents
  - Admin dashboard for reviewing and approving/rejecting agent registrations

---

## 3. Data Redundancy & High Availability
- [ ] **Database clustering/HA:**
  - Use PostgreSQL clustering or managed HA Postgres
  - Automated backups and tested restore procedures
- [ ] **Redis clustering:**
  - Use Redis cluster or managed Redis with failover
- [ ] **Workload state replication:**
  - Replicate stateful workloads across multiple agents/nodes
  - Automated failover and recovery
  - Regular backup/restore tests
- [ ] **Disaster recovery plan:**
  - Documented and tested recovery procedures for all critical components
  - Rollback mechanism for failed deployments

---

## 4. Ranking, Pooling, and Intelligent Scheduling
- [ ] **Intelligent workload placement:**
  - Resource-based scheduling (CPU, memory, disk, network requirements)
  - Affinity/anti-affinity rules for workload placement
- [ ] **Agent pool segmentation:**
  - Pools by region, capability, environment (dev/staging/prod)
  - Dynamic pool creation and node reassignment
- [ ] **Expose node ranking and pool status in dashboard and onboarding app**

---

## 5. Monitoring, Alerting, and Logging
- [ ] **Monitoring infrastructure:**
  - Centralized monitoring for all nodes, agents, workloads, and backend
  - Real-time dashboards for health, status, and alerts
- [ ] **Alerting:**
  - Automated alerts for node/agent failures, data loss risk, pool health, and security events
- [ ] **Comprehensive logging:**
  - Structured, centralized logs for all components
  - Sufficient detail for debugging production issues
  - Log aggregation and search

---

## 6. Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Onboarding:** Test onboarding app on macOS, Windows, Linux
- [ ] **Agent lifecycle:** Simulate network drops, Docker restarts, sleep/wake, version upgrades
- [ ] **Ranking & scheduling:** Force node failures, verify ranking and placement adjust
- [ ] **Pooling:** Deploy workloads to different pools, test failover and reassignment
- [ ] **Data redundancy:** Kill node with stateful workload, verify data is safe and recoverable
- [ ] **Monitoring & alerting:** Dashboard and onboarding app reflect real-time state and alerts
- [ ] **Disaster recovery:** Simulate failures and test recovery/rollback

---

## 7. Automation, Logging, and Support
- [ ] **Automate log collection and error reporting** for all nodes
- [ ] **Provide reset/cleanup script** for users (integrated into onboarding app)
- [ ] **Support channel** for onboarding help during test and production

---

## 8. Critical Resilience & Pitfalls
- [ ] **Agent resilience:** Exponential backoff, retry logic, health checks
- [ ] **Network issues:** Offline queuing, reconnect logic
- [ ] **Resource monitoring:** Alert on CPU/mem/disk/network thresholds
- [ ] **Port conflicts:** Dynamic port allocation
- [ ] **Logs & rollback:** Store logs, provide cleanup scripts
- [ ] **Onboarding app must handle all edge cases gracefully and provide actionable feedback**
- [ ] **Security:** All network communication encrypted, agent authentication enforced, registration approval required

---

## 9. Stretch Goals
- [ ] One-click installer for all platforms
- [ ] Auto-update agent binaries and onboarding app
- [ ] Gamified node ranking (badges, leaderboards)
- [ ] Advanced cluster management UI in onboarding app
- [ ] Multi-cloud and hybrid deployment support

---

## 10. Mindset & Principles
- **One-shot, one-kill:** Every step must work the first time. No excuses.
- **Zero onboarding friction:** If a user gets stuck, it's a blocker.
- **Test everything, break things, learn fast.**
- **Every node is a potential failureâ€”design for resilience.**
- **Data safety is non-negotiable.**
- **Visualize everythingâ€”make the invisible visible.**
- **Onboarding app is the user's first and lasting impressionâ€”make it beautiful and bulletproof.**
- **Security and recovery are non-negotiable for production.**
