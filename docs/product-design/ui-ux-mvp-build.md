## Acceptance Criteria (Examples)
- Dashboard loads in <2s and displays real-time system health
- Workload deployment form validates required fields and shows success/error
- Node list updates in real time as nodes join/leave
- Marketplace apps can be deployed with one click
- Onboarding tour highlights key features for new users
